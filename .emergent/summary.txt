**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application with a complete frontend built using React and Tailwind CSS. The frontend is a single-page portfolio with the following sections: Header, Hero, About, Timeline, Projects, Skills, Why Work With Me?, and Contact. It supports both light and dark modes with custom color palettes. All content is driven by a mock data file (). The backend is the basic FastAPI template and has not been integrated with the frontend yet.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent was trying to resolve a deployment readiness issue. The  was repeatedly and incorrectly reporting that the  and  files were missing, which blocked the deployment process.

- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Deployment Agent Failure (P0)**
    -   The  consistently fails, reporting that  files are missing, even though they exist and are correctly configured. This is preventing deployment.

        -   Invoked the  multiple times, all resulting in the same error.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Invoke the  one more time for a final check.
        2.  If it fails again, the sub-agent is likely faulty. The next agent should inform the user about the faulty sub-agent and propose to proceed with deployment manually, given that all manual checks have passed.
    -   **Why fix this issue?** The application cannot be deployed until the readiness check is passed or bypassed.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **Task 1: Backend Implementation (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** .
    -   **Action:** Create Pydantic models and FastAPI endpoints to serve the portfolio data (Projects, Experience, Skills) currently hardcoded in .
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The website will be backed by a dynamic API instead of static mock data.

-   **Task 2: Frontend-Backend Integration (P1)**
    -   **Where to resume:** All components in .
    -   **Action:** Replace the mock data imports with  API calls to the newly created backend endpoints.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The frontend will fetch and display data from the backend, completing the full-stack connection.

-   **Task 3: Contact Form Backend Integration (P2)**
    -   **Where to resume:**  and .
    -   **Action:** Implement the backend logic to handle contact form submissions, potentially using a service like Web3Forms or a custom email-sending endpoint.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** The contact form will become functional.

**Future Tasks:**
-   Implement Nice-to-have features from the original brief if requested by the user, such as Easter eggs (e.g., Konami code) or a customizable Why This Role? section.

-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, React Context API (for theme management), .
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Motor (for async MongoDB).
- **Data Management:** All frontend content is currently centralized in a mock data file ().
- **Development Environment:** Services are managed by .

**key DB schema**
- **status_checks:** {id, client_name, timestamp} (This is a default table, no portfolio-specific schema exists yet).

**changes in tech stack**
- None.

**All files of reference**
-   : The source of all content for the portfolio. This file will be replaced by API calls.
-   : Contains the global styles and the definitions for the light and dark mode color palettes.
-   : The entry point for all future backend development.
-   : Was the subject of many user iterations and contains specific dark mode class overrides.
-   : Contains the updated page title and favicon links.
-    & : The files at the center of the current deployment-blocking issue.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   The  package is installed but unused. It should be removed from  by running yarn remove v1.22.22
[1/2] Removing module lottie-react...
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/remove for documentation about this command..

**key api endpoints**
-   : A basic Hello World endpoint.
-   No application-specific endpoints have been created yet.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **The entire application frontend is driven by mock data.** The next major step is to build the backend and integrate it. The user has approved the current frontend design after many iterations.
-   **Deployment is BLOCKED** by what appears to be a false positive from the , which claims  files are missing. Your immediate priority is to resolve this. Do not trust the deployer agent's output on this without verifying; the files have been confirmed to exist multiple times.
-   The user is highly engaged and provides very specific feedback. Pay close attention to their requests and confirm changes with screenshots.
-   Browser caching, especially for the favicon, has been a point of confusion for the user. Be prepared to explain it again if necessary.
